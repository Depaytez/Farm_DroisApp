# Farm DroisApp: Smart Farm Management System
**Farm DroisApp** is an innovative farm management system designed to empower Nigerian farmers with cutting-edge technology. Leveraging the power of Next.js, React, TypeScript for the web and mobile frontend, and Python for robust backend services, Farm DroisApp aims to optimize farm operations, enhance productivity, and ensure sustainable agricultural practices.

## Vision
To be the leading digital platform for farmers in Nigeria, providing accessible, intelligent, and real-time insights to transform traditional farming into a data-driven, efficient, and profitable venture.

## Features (Future Development)
Farm DroisApp is envisioned to offer a comprehensive suite of features to support modern farming:

* **Real-time Weather & Smart Farm Plans:** Provide accurate, hyper-local weather forecasts and generate intelligent, adaptive farm plans based on environmental conditions and crop requirements.
* **Daily Farm Schedules & Soil Monitoring:** Automate daily task scheduling and integrate with sensors for continuous soil health monitoring (moisture, nutrients, pH).
* **Pest & Disease Alerts:** Utilize AI and image recognition to detect early signs of pests and diseases, providing timely alerts and recommended interventions.
* **Farm Record-Keeping & Cost Optimization:** Centralize all farm records, including planting, harvesting, inventory, and financial transactions, to enable detailed cost analysis and optimization.
* **Market Insights & AI Advice:** Offer real-time market price data for various crops and livestock, coupled with AI-driven advice on optimal planting times, crop rotation, and sales strategies.
* **Farm Surveillance & Automation:** Integrate with smart devices for remote farm surveillance and enable automation of irrigation, fertilization, and other routine tasks.

## Technologies Used
* **Frontend:**
